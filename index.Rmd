## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to third-party interventions in civil wars. Given that on average third-party intervention prolongs conflict duration, I want to investigate whether motive plays a role. Are altruistic third-party interventions less likely to exacerbate conflict than self-interested interventions? 

For this I want to work with the COW dataset.
